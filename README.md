# CCNA Lab Practice & Enterprise Network Project 

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of CCNA practice labs and a complete enterprise network deployment project that I developed to prepare for and pass the Cisco CCNA 200-301 certification exam. The repository is structured into two main directories, each serving a specific purpose in my networking education journey.

## 🏢 Enterprise Network Project
Project Description
This is a fully functional enterprise network simulation that demonstrates real-world networking concepts at scale. The project features a multi-site architecture with dual ISP connectivity, hierarchical network design (Core-Distribution-Access), and comprehensive security implementations.

Key Features:
Dual ISP Connectivity with failover capabilities

Hierarchical Network Design (Core, Distribution, Access layers)

VLAN Segmentation for different device types (Data, Voice, Management, Wireless, Servers)

Gateway Redundancy using HSRP

Dynamic Routing with OSPF

Layer 2 & 3 EtherChannels for link aggregation

Comprehensive Security (ACLs, Port Security, DHCP Snooping, DAI)

Network Services (DHCP, DNS, NTP, Syslog, SSH)

IPv6 Readiness with dual-stack configuration

Wireless Integration with WLC and LWAPs

Technologies Implemented:
VLANs, VTP, STP (Rapid PVST+)

HSRP, OSPF, Static Routing

NAT (Static, Dynamic PAT)

DHCP, DNS, NTP, SNMP

SSH, ACLs, Port Security

IPv6 Addressing and Routing

Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) configuration
